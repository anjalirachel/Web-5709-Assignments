## Getting Started

**[Optional]** If needing to provide the marker with a copy of the project that should run on their local machine for development, testing and/or marking purposes. Please include the following sections.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab / assignnment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

```
Node.js
npm
Visual Studio Code

```

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing the Node.js

A step by step series of installing Node.js

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```
Install Node.js and npm

In Visual Studio Code Terminal create a new React Project

- npx create-react-app my-react-app

Navigate to your react app

- cd my-react-app

Start the npm server to see your react app run locally

- npm start

```

## Running the tests

If needing to run automated tests, then explain how to run the automated tests for this system. If this section is not needed, ** you may delete **.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

1. First login with your Github account.
2. Authorize Netlify.
3. Select the Repo that is to be deployed.
4. Configure your settings.
5. Build your site.
6. The site is deployed.
