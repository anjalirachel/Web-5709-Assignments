## Getting Started

**[Optional]** If needing to provide the marker with a copy of the project that should run on their local machine for development, testing and/or marking purposes. Please include the following sections.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab / assignnment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

```
Node.js
npm
Visual Studio Code
React.js

```

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing the Node.js

A step by step series of installing Node.js

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```
Install Node.js and npm

In Visual Studio Code Terminal create a new React Project

- npx create-react-app my-react-app

Navigate to your react app

- cd my-react-app

Start the npm server to see your react app run locally

- npm start

```

## Deployment

I created a new private repository on github for Assignment 1 project deployment and then I mirrored my gitlab repository with the github repository. I pushed my code to gitlab. Because of mirroring my project was reflected automatically to my github account. Then, I imported the assignment 1 project on netlify from github and setup build settings to deploy the application. Finally, it was deployed and live on the above mentioned link.

1. First login with your Github account.
2. Authorize Netlify.
3. Select the Repo that is to be deployed.
4. Configure your settings.
5. Build your site.
6. The site is deployed.

## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

- [React.js](https://react.dev/learn/) - The web framework used
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) - The deployment application used

## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any Artificial Intelligence Tools or Plugins, then provide a list of the tools or plugins used, the prompt used, the code generated by the AI, where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.

- How to create an Image Slider in React

```

Creating an image slider in React involves several steps. Below is a comprehensive guide to create a simple yet functional image slider using React. We'll use hooks for state management and CSS for styling.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Create a New React Project (if you don't have one)

If you don't already have a React project, you can create one using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app image-slider
cd image-slider
npm start
```

#### Step 2: Create the Image Slider Component

1. Create a new file for the image slider component, for example, `ImageSlider.js`.

```jsx
// src/ImageSlider.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./ImageSlider.css"; // Import CSS file for styling

const ImageSlider = ({ images }) => {
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

  const nextSlide = () => {
    setCurrentIndex((prevIndex) =>
      prevIndex === images.length - 1 ? 0 : prevIndex + 1
    );
  };

  const prevSlide = () => {
    setCurrentIndex((prevIndex) =>
      prevIndex === 0 ? images.length - 1 : prevIndex - 1
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="slider">
      <button className="left-arrow" onClick={prevSlide}>
        &#10094;
      </button>
      <div className="slider-wrapper">
        {images.map((image, index) => (
          <div
            className={index === currentIndex ? "slide active" : "slide"}
            key={index}
          >
            {index === currentIndex && (
              <img src={image} alt={`Slide ${index}`} className="image" />
            )}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <button className="right-arrow" onClick={nextSlide}>
        &#10095;
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ImageSlider;
```

2. Create a CSS file for styling the image slider.

```css
/* src/ImageSlider.css */
.slider {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.slider-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.slide {
  min-width: 100%;
  opacity: 0;
  transition-duration: 1s ease;
}

.slide.active {
  opacity: 1;
  transition-duration: 1s;
}

.image {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.left-arrow,
.right-arrow {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  z-index: 10;
}

.left-arrow {
  left: 10px;
}

.right-arrow {
  right: 10px;
}
```

#### Step 3: Use the Image Slider Component in Your App

1. Update your `App.js` or create a new component to use the `ImageSlider` component.

```jsx
// src/App.js
import React from "react";
import ImageSlider from "./ImageSlider";

const images = [
  "https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Slide+1",
  "https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Slide+2",
  "https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Slide+3",
];

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Image Slider</h1>
      <ImageSlider images={images} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

2. Make sure to include the `ImageSlider.css` file in your `ImageSlider` component file.

#### Summary

In this guide, we created a simple image slider in React using hooks and CSS for styling. The slider includes left and right navigation buttons to switch between images. This basic structure can be extended with more features such as auto-play, pagination dots, or animations for a more enhanced user experience.

```

```

- I have a playlist grid from where if I click it should go to a page where all music will be there. So basically I need to navigate to other page. And using react router is giving me error. So please provide me with other options

```

Using window.location (Not Ideal for SPAs)
This method causes a full page reload, but it is a straightforward alternative.

jsx
Copy code
const PlaylistGrid = () => {
const handleClick = () => {
window.location.href = '/music';
};

return (

<div>
<h1>Playlist Grid</h1>
<div onClick={handleClick} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
Go to Music Page
</div>
</div>
);
};

export default PlaylistGrid;

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Create a Navigation Context
First, create a navigation context that will provide the current page and the onNavigate function.

jsx
Copy code
// NavigationContext.js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const NavigationContext = createContext();

export const NavigationProvider = ({ children }) => {
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState('playlist'); // default page

const onNavigate = (page) => {
setCurrentPage(page);
};

return (
<NavigationContext.Provider value={{ currentPage, onNavigate }}>
{children}
</NavigationContext.Provider>
);
};

export const useNavigation = () => useContext(NavigationContext);
Step 2: Create Components and Use the Navigation Context
Create your components that will use the onNavigate function provided by the Navigation Context.

jsx
Copy code
// PlaylistGrid.js
import React from 'react';
import { useNavigation } from './NavigationContext';

const PlaylistGrid = () => {
const { onNavigate } = useNavigation();

return (

<div>
<h1>Playlist Grid</h1>
<div onClick={() => onNavigate('music')} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
Go to Music Page
</div>
</div>
);
};

export default PlaylistGrid;
jsx
Copy code
// MusicPage.js
import React from 'react';

const MusicPage = () => (

  <div>
    <h1>Music Page</h1>
    <p>All music will be listed here.</p>
  </div>
);

export default MusicPage;
Step 3: Conditionally Render Components Based on Navigation State
In your main App component, conditionally render the appropriate component based on the current navigation state.

jsx
Copy code
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationProvider, useNavigation } from './NavigationContext';
import PlaylistGrid from './PlaylistGrid';
import MusicPage from './MusicPage';

const App = () => {
const { currentPage } = useNavigation();

return (

<div>
{currentPage === 'playlist' && <PlaylistGrid />}
{currentPage === 'music' && <MusicPage />}
</div>
);
};

const RootApp = () => (
<NavigationProvider>
<App />
</NavigationProvider>
);

export default RootApp;

```
